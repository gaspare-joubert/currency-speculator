Calculate the % appreciation/depreciation when selling a currency
X = 0.11
Y = 0.12

X * (100/100 + z/100) = Y
                    Z = ((Y/X)-1)*100
----------------------------------------------------------
Calculate the % appreciation/depreciation when buying a currency
Y = 6.28
Z = 5.7275 
X = 8.797770701

6.28 - (6.28 * (X/100)) = 5.7275

Y - (Y * (X/100)) = Z
                X = -(((Z-Y)/Y)*100)

In order to calculate the % commission charged when supplier is selling a currency:
* Determine how much of the new currency you will receive from the bank/broker.
* Determine how much of the new currency you would receive hypothetically if you were to use the current exchange rate.

For example on 10 September 2020 at 17:53
Currency Online Group would sell 1075.90Euro at a cost of £1000 @ 1.0759 
The current exchange rate would sell 1082.40Euro at a cost of £1000 @ 1.08
Using the following formula:
Z = ((Y/X)-1)*100

X = 1075.90
Y = 1082.40
Z = ((1082.40/1075.90)-1)*100
Z = 0.60%

In order to calculate the % commission charged when supplier is buying back a currency:
* Determine how much of the new currency you will receive from the bank/broker.
* Determine how much of the new currency you would receive hypothetically if you were to use the current exchange rate.

For example on 10 September 2020 at 17:53
Currency Online Group would buy back 1000Euro, resulting in £889.05, @ 0.89 (1/1.1248)
The current exchange rate would buy back 1000Euro, resulting in £925.43 @ 0.93
Using the following formula:
X = -(((Z-Y)/Y)*100)

Y = 925.43
Z = 889.05
X = -(((889.05-925.43)/925.43)*100)
X = 3.93%
